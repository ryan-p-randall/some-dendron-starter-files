# _{{fm.title}}_ Reading Notes  

## Citation Info  

<!-- Comment: you can replace this biblatex section with a citation template in whatever style you tend to use, if you don't use Pandoc or something similar for generating citations. I currently edit these citations by hand. -->

<!-- Comment: You can change any of the below text. Make it your own! -->

## What was the thesis? Main argument?  

## Were there any side arguments that were significant?  

## How does this text fit within the literature? Historiography? 

(What is it adding to the arguments already out there? does it challenge dominant trends in the literature?)  

## What methodology did the author use?  

## Evidence? What kinds of sources did the author use?  

## Organization? How did the author organize the flow of the argument and narrative?  

## Critiques? Do you see any problems? Praise?  

## Epistemology? (this is less important based on your field)  

## Anything else of interest you would want to remember? Maybe something that will be useful for your dissertation.
